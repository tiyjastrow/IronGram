# IronGram
```
Turn the IronGram project we made in class into a SnapChat-like service by making it delete the photos briefly after they are first viewed.
```

```
Delete photos from the database and the disk if they were viewed by the /photos route after a constant number of (10 or more) seconds ago. 
This requirement is open-ended -- you need to figure out how to do it.
```
```
Create an input box in the upload form to let the user specify how many seconds they want the photo to exist. Store the number in the Photo entity. 
Then use that number instead of 10 seconds in your deletion code.
```
```
Create a checkbox in the upload form to let the user specify whether the photo should be public. Store the boolean in the Photo entity.
```
```
Create a JSON route called /public-photos which takes a username as an argument. Make it return a list of photos sent by that user which were marked as public. 
(Remember: We're just returning JSON data here, not the actual photos.)
